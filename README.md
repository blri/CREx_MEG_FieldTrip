# CREx_MEG_FieldTrip
Matlab toolbox using FieldTrip functions to process MEG data. 
Developed by the <a href="http://blricrex.hypotheses.org/" target="_blank">CREx</a> (Centre of Experimental Resources of the <a href="http://www.blri.fr/" target="_blank">Brain and Language Research Institute</a>). 

The general purpose of theses scripts is to automatized data processing of MEG data sets and to help interpret the results by editing appropriate representation of the outputs. 
Figures of results are automatically saved in specific directories created in the data directory. New data are saved in matrices which names are link to the specific processings.

* **batches directory** : scripts to launch data processing on an entire set of data

* **ft_CREx** : toolbox containing all the functions that interface those of FieldTrip toolbox
